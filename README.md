# 🐟 Deep Learning Fish Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to classify different species of fish using a large-scale fish dataset. The model uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture with various optimization techniques.

*This project was developed within the scope of "Akbank Deep Learning Bootcamp: New Generation Project Camp". I would like to thank the Global AI Hub Türkiye team for their support and this opportunity they provided.*

## 🎯 Features
